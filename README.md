# led-brightness-control-app
An android application which logs in users through sending an OTP to their mobile number and register the user. 
Then the app check for the paired devices and if it's a blub; the connection will be successful. 
The bulb can then be controlled using the app. 

I'll update the UI as well as the application to control:
1. Bulbs
2. Fan
3. AC
4. Gate
5. Doors
6. Switches, etc...
